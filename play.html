        SCENE III. The same. ANTONIO's house.
        Enter ANTONIO and     <b>PANTHINO</b>
    </h5>
    <p>Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO</p>

        <p>
            Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that<br>
            Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?<br> 
        </p>
        <h6><b>ANTONIO</b></h6>
        <p>
        Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that<br>
        Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?<br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>PANTHINO</b></h6>
        
        <p>'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.</p><br>
        
        
        <h6><b>ANTONIO</b></h6>
        
        <p>Why, what of him?</p><br>
        
        
        <h6><b>PANTHINO</b></h6>
        <p>
        He wonder'd that your lordship<br>
        Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,<br>
        While other men, of slender reputation,<br>
        Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:<br>
        Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;<br>
        Some to discover islands far away;<br>
        Some to the studious universities.<br>
        For any or for all these exercises,<br>
        He said that Proteus your son was meet,<br>
        And did request me to importune you<br>
        To let him spend his time no more at home,<br>
        Which would be great impeachment to his age,<br>
        In having known no travel in his youth.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>ANTONIO</b></h6>
        <p>
        Nor need'st thou much importune me to that<br>
        Whereon this month I have been hammering.<br>
        I have consider'd well his loss of time<br>
        And how he cannot be a perfect man,<br>
        Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:<br>
        Experience is by industry achieved<br>
        And perfected by the swift course of time.<br>
        Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?<br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>PANTHINO</b></h6>
        
        I think your lordship is not ignorant<br>
        How his companion, youthful Valentine,<br>
        Attends the emperor in his royal court.<br>
        
        
        <h6><b>ANTONIO</b></h6>
        <p>I know it well.<br>
        </p>
        
        
        <h6><b>PANTHINO</b></h6>
        <p>
        'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:<br>
        There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,<br>
        Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.<br>
        And be in eye of every exercise<br>
        Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>ANTONIO</b></h6>
        <p>
        I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:<br>
        And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,<br>
        The execution of it shall make known.<br>
        Even with the speediest expedition<br>
        I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.<br>
        </p>
        
        
        <h6><b>PANTHINO</b></h6>
        <p>
        To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,</a><br>
        With other gentlemen of good esteem,</a><br>
        Are journeying to salute the emperor</a><br>
        And to commend their service to his will.</a><br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>ANTONIO</b></h6>
        <p>
        Good company; with them shall Proteus go:<br>
        And, in good time! now will we break with him.<br>
        </p>

        <p><i>Enter PROTEUS</i></p>
        
        
        <h6><b>PROTEUS</b></h6>
        <p>
        Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!<br>
        Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;<br>
        Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.<br>
        O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,<br>
        To seal our happiness with their consents!<br>
        O heavenly Julia!</a><br>
        </p>
        
        
        <h6><b>ANTONIO</b></h6>
        <p>
        How now! what letter are you reading there?<br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>PROTEUS</b></h6>
        <p>
        May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two<br>
        Of commendations sent from Valentine,<br>
        Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>ANTONIO</b></h6>
        <p>
        Lend me the letter; let me see what news.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>PROTEUS</b></h6>
        <p>
        There is no news, my lord, but that he writes<br>
        How happily he lives, how well beloved<br>
        And daily graced by the emperor;<br>
        Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>ANTONIO</b></h6>
        <p>
        And how stand you affected to his wish?</a><br>
        </p>
        
        
        <h6><b>PROTEUS</b></h6>
        <p>
        As one relying on your lordship's will<br>
        And not depending on his friendly wish.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>ANTONIO</b></h6>
        <p>
        My will is something sorted with his wish.<br>
        Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;<br>
        For what I will, I will, and there an end.<br>
        I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time<br>
        With Valentinus in the emperor's court:<br>
        What maintenance he from his friends receives,<br>
        Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.<br>
        To-morrow be in readiness to go:<br>
        Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>PROTEUS</b></h6>
        <p>
        My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:<br>
        Please you, deliberate a day or two.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>ANTONIO</b></h6>
        <p>
        Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:<br>
        No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.<br>
        Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd<br>
        To hasten on his expedition.<br>
        </p>

        <p><i>Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO</i></p>
        
        
        <h6><b>PROTEUS</b></h6>
        <p>
        Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,<br>
        And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.<br>
        I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,<br>
        Lest he should take exceptions to my love;<br>
        And with the vantage of mine own excuse<br>
        Hath he excepted most against my love.<br>
        O, how this spring of love resembleth<br>
        The uncertain glory of an April day,<br>
        Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,<br>
        And by and by a cloud takes all away!<br>
        </p>

        <p><i>Re-enter PANTHINO</i></p>
        
        
        <h6><b>PANTHINO</b></h6>
        <p>
        <a name="89">Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:<br>
        <a name="90">He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h6><b>PROTEUS</b></h6>
        <p>
        Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,<br>
        And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'<br>
        </p>
        
        <p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
