        <blockquote>
        <a name="1">Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that</a><br>
        <a name="2">Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?</a><br>
        </blockquote>
        
        <a name="speech2"><b>PANTHINO</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="3">'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.</a><br>
        </blockquote>
        
        <a name="speech3"><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="4">Why, what of him?</a><br>
        </blockquote>
        
        <a name="speech4"><b>PANTHINO</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="5">                  He wonder'd that your lordship</a><br>
        <a name="6">Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,</a><br>
        <a name="7">While other men, of slender reputation,</a><br>
        <a name="8">Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:</a><br>
        <a name="9">Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;</a><br>
        <a name="10">Some to discover islands far away;</a><br>
        <a name="11">Some to the studious universities.</a><br>
        <a name="12">For any or for all these exercises,</a><br>
        <a name="13">He said that Proteus your son was meet,</a><br>
        <a name="14">And did request me to importune you</a><br>
        <a name="15">To let him spend his time no more at home,</a><br>
        <a name="16">Which would be great impeachment to his age,</a><br>
        <a name="17">In having known no travel in his youth.</a><br>
        </blockquote>
        
        <a name="speech5"><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="18">Nor need'st thou much importune me to that</a><br>
        <a name="19">Whereon this month I have been hammering.</a><br>
        <a name="20">I have consider'd well his loss of time</a><br>
        <a name="21">And how he cannot be a perfect man,</a><br>
        <a name="22">Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:</a><br>
        <a name="23">Experience is by industry achieved</a><br>
        <a name="24">And perfected by the swift course of time.</a><br>
        <a name="25">Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?</a><br>
        </blockquote>
        
        <a name="speech6"><b>PANTHINO</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="26">I think your lordship is not ignorant</a><br>
        <a name="27">How his companion, youthful Valentine,</a><br>
        <a name="28">Attends the emperor in his royal court.</a><br>
        </blockquote>
        
        <a name="speech7"><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="29">I know it well.</a><br>
        </blockquote>
        
        <a name="speech8"><b>PANTHINO</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="30">'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:</a><br>
        <a name="31">There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,</a><br>
        <a name="32">Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.</a><br>
        <a name="33">And be in eye of every exercise</a><br>
        <a name="34">Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.</a><br>
        </blockquote>
        
        <a name="speech9"><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="35">I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:</a><br>
        <a name="36">And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,</a><br>
        <a name="37">The execution of it shall make known.</a><br>
        <a name="38">Even with the speediest expedition</a><br>
        <a name="39">I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.</a><br>
        </blockquote>
        
        <a name="speech10"><b>PANTHINO</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="40">To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,</a><br>
        <a name="41">With other gentlemen of good esteem,</a><br>
        <a name="42">Are journeying to salute the emperor</a><br>
        <a name="43">And to commend their service to his will.</a><br>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
        <a name="44">Good company; with them shall Proteus go:</a><br>
        <a name="45">And, in good time! now will we break with him.</a><br>
        <p><i>Enter PROTEUS</i></p>

        <a name="47">Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;</a><br>
        <a name="48">Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.</a><br>
        <a name="49">O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,</a><br>
        <a name="50">To seal our happiness with their consents!</a><br>
        <a name="51">O heavenly Julia!</a><br>

        </blockquote>
        
        <a name="speech14"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="53">May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two</a><br>
        <a name="54">Of commendations sent from Valentine,</a><br>
        <a name="55">Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.</a><br>

        <a name="speech16"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="57">There is no news, my lord, but that he writes</a><br>

        <a name="59">And daily graced by the emperor;</a><br>
        <a name="60">Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.</a><br>

        </blockquote>
        
        <a name="speech18"><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="62">As one relying on your lordship's will</a><br>

        <a name="65">Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;</a><br>
        <a name="66">For what I will, I will, and there an end.</a><br>
        <a name="67">I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time</a><br>
        <a name="68">With Valentinus in the emperor's court:</a><br>
